# Ionic Tour of Heroes

This is the Ionic version of the classic Angular Tour of Heroes tutorial. Unlike the Angular Tour-of-Heroes in this repository, which utilizes Angular's standalone components feature, this Ionic implementation uses Angular version 17.2 in a traditional, **non-standalone** mode.

## Features

- **Superhero Dashboard**: View top heroes and search for heroes across the database.
- **Hero Details**: View and edit details of individual heroes.
- **Hero Management**: Add, remove, and manage heroes in the database.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Ionic CLI
- Angular CLI

Ensure you have the above prerequisites installed before proceeding with the setup.

## Setup and Installation

   ```

4. Serve the application:
